This is a web application written in React and Django rest. 

It allows all users Upload new Images which are processed by the django backend and stored on an AWS S3 bucket. 

Users can view all free stock photos that have been previously uploaded by other users.

This project can be used as a boiler plate for more ambitious projects 

Here's why:
